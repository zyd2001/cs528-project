### Clone this repo to both the Attacker and the Victim
### `./launch_gradio_server.sh` on Victim to start a vulnerable Gradio server
### `./launch_internal_server.sh` on Victim to start an "internal" server with a "secret" file
### Observe that the internal server (a directory explorer built in Python) is usable on Victim but not from elsewhere
### `./exploit_internal.sh` on Attacker
### Click the link to obtain the secret as Attacker!
